# A Blog

A web blog which allows a user to post a journal style entry with fixed sub categories which assist with creating content.

## Dependencies and Frameworks

Backend created with Express and Node.js. Front end created with Angular 8. No SQL Database at MongoDB's MLabs. Authentication using bcrypt and passport. Additional features provided by Nodemailer and Mongoose. Hosting by Heroku.

## A blog

This is a simple blog with fixed sub headings which help a user form content. This is a full stack application with full create, read, update and delete functionality limited to content a specific user has created. 

## Proof of Concept

~~This application can be seen here: https://guarded-peak-44051.herokuapp.com/~~
Previous blog was created in Angular 8, however updating to 9 introduced some breaking changes so I decided to redo the blog from the ground up in React. Significant improvements still required, and not suitable for production at this time.
